# Stream Discussion Plan
- Warm up the crowd a bit and talk back and forth with chat.
- Questions to ask:
  - How many of you are confused by how to use the latest AI tools?
  - How many of you are actively learning how to use AI tools, either in your spare time or at work?
  - What are the most common tools that you're using?
  - What are the most common problems you're running into?
    - I'm struggling to figure out how to get consistent results from the tools.
    - I'm struggling to figure out how to get the tools to do what I want.
    - Lots of times I don't know what the tools are good for and what is an unreasonable expectation. 
  - What tools do you want to learn more about?
  - What are tools that you've heard about but haven't had a chance to try yet?
- Introduce the topic of the stream
  - I've been struggling with how to take advantage of these tools. I am certain that they are super high leverage, but they're not intuitive to me to learn.
  - The tools are changing so fast that it's hard to keep up.
  - I wanted a place to collect everything I've learned.
  - I felt like I needed some extra accountability to keep me going.
  - Because I keep doing such crazy deep dives, it felt like I should be sharing it with others.
