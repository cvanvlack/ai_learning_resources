## Inline Copilot Chat
Inline chat is probably the feature I use most often, after the copilot ghost text/chat completions.

- Can insert code into a new file
- Can add tests
- Can tell you how to run tests
- `@workspace`
- `@vscode`
- right click on a line and select "Ask Copilot"
- The benefits of having this all in the IDE is that it prevents breaking the "flow". If you have to do a google search for the error, scroll through an ad-filled blog post, and then copy and paste the code into your IDE, you've broken the flow. 
- `/explain`
  - Really helps when jumping into a project or a set of code that you haven't worked on before to help you get your footing.
  - Great for use on regular expressions
  - Chat can create links to files that you can click on to open in your IDE
  - You can use the `#` to choose more context to intentionally send to co-pilot.
  - You can have multiple conversation threads open at once.
  - When copilot doesn't have context on something, it will specifically ask you for more context. This is especially important when it's asking for debugging information as you don't want co-pilot accidentally scraping sensitive information and sending it to Github. Hence why it asks you.
